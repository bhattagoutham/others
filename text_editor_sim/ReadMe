This project is a barebones text editor.It tries to emulate the ViM.
It has 2 modes, they are
1) Command Mode
2) Insert mode

To build this project. Go to the folder and type "make". This will give you an executable
file called "edit".

You can start the editor using the following command
eg: ./edit <file_name>

Filename can be new or existing. If it is new then it will create a file after you save it.
If it is an existing file it will display the contents on the screen, and then enters into command mode.

From the Command Mode you can perform the following operations
1) execute system calls   --> :!<command> --> eg: :!ls + (Enter Key)
2) save the file and exit --> :wq + (Enter Key)
3) over ride exit		  --> :q! + (Enter Key)
3) normal exit			  --> :q + (Enter Key)
4) insert mode			  ---> i

If you want to enter insert mode, you need to press 'i'. In this mode you can edit the file.
if you try inserting a charecter in the middle of a line, it will replace the character, 
but does not shift the line. To delete a character press backspace key (It might give amibiguous result sometimes).
You can navigate the text using arrow keys.


Note:
If by chance the program changes the settings of you terminal, please execute "reset" command. It will revert back 
the original setting of your terminal.
