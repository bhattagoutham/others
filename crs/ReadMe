to create executables: make all

to start crs --> ./server
to start client --> ./client "crs_ip_address"

1) The CRS does not read from a pre existing repo file.
2) Multiprocessing of client requests is not implemented,
   hence sockets are predefined.
3) The client considers only the files present in its directory.
   No home directory implemented.
4) search is implemented only for absolute name

share:
share "relative_path_name"
search:
search "file_name"
get:
get ip=ip_address_of_client fname="file_name"
del:
del "relative_path_name"
RPC:
exec ip=ip_address_of_client cmd="command"

The clients are terminated by typing "exit" at the command prompt
while to shut down the server press ctrl+c. Only after exiting the
CRS the Repo file is created. The log and repo file are in the servers
directory.
